# Todo App with Update Counter

This is a simple Todo App built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to add tasks, update them, and delete them. The app has a twist: every time a task is updated, the number of updates is counted and displayed. If the same task is updated, its color changes to orange.

## Features

- Add tasks with an optional count to add the task multiple times.
- Update tasks and track the number of updates.
- Change the color of a task to orange if it is updated.
- Delete tasks.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following software installed on your machine:

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the app.

## Usage

1. Enter a task in the input field. To add the task multiple times, add a number at the end. For example, "Make Food 3" will add "Make Food" 3 times.

3. Click the ✏️ button to update the task. Each update increments the counter and changes the task color to orange if it is updated.
